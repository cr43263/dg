First "Install" Instructions:

1) Open the Blanks folder and place a copy of them at the same level as the Blanks folder (not inside it). Add them to the .git ignore list
  




2) Make sure village_master.py, menu_driv3r.py, menu_tester.py and the three files above are all on the same level in the same folder.

  - right click on the shortcut
    - click change icon, select the .ico file that comes with this package
